Our project is a weather monitoring table offering energy-saving suggestions based on current temperatures.

**Team Members:**

- **Ruijie Fan**: Responsible for fetching weather data from the 'onWeather' API, designing the weather forecast display layout, and architecting the program's basic structure.
- **Haocheng Lu**: Handled user authentication and registration, integrated Google Maps, managed data retrieval from Firebase to annotate cities on the map, implemented conditional pop-up rendering based on temperature, and developed routing functionality within the application.

**Implemented Functionalities:**

1. **API Usage**: Utilized Google Maps API and onWeatherAPI for mapping and weather data respectively.
2. **Database Integration**: Incorporated Firebase Authentication for user login, Firestore for storing city geographical data, and Firebase Storage for the login interface background image.
3. **External JSON Handling**: Employed JSON data from OnWeatherAPI.
4. **Conditional Rendering**: Based on temperature data, we dynamically display different pages.
5. **Data Manipulation**: Added a search feature to filter city weather information by user-entered city names.
6. **User Interface**: Developed login and registration interfaces with buttons and input fields.
7. **Component Interaction**: Implemented parent-child component communication, passing user-input city names as props.
8. **Multi-Component Architecture**: Our application comprises several interconnected components.
9. **Navigation with React Router**: Employed React Router for seamless page navigation.
10. **Programming Approach**: Combined functional and class-based components.

This comprehensive approach ensures robust functionality and user-friendly interaction in our weather monitoring and energy-saving project.
